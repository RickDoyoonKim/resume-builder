# Overview
This project is a Resume Builder web application targeting experienced IT professionals (myself as the primary user). The main value is the ability to quickly generate a company-tailored resume using my existing career data, providing a more customized and efficient experience than services like Indeed.

# Core Features
- Resume creation using Angular Reactive Forms (fields: Full Name, Job Title, Summary, Work Experience, Education, Skills, Projects)
- Live preview of the resume as the user types (best UI/UX style to be chosen by the developer)
- Export resume as a styled PDF (single modern template, but extensible)
- Support for file attachments (e.g., images, portfolio links) in experience/project sections
- English-only resume support (no multi-language)
- Anonymous usage (no login/signup required)
- Responsive UI for desktop, tablet, and mobile (portfolio-grade design)
- (Optional) Autosave/draft feature if technically feasible

# User Experience
- Target user: Experienced IT professional
- User flow: Enter resume data → see live preview → export as PDF
- Preview style: Developer will select the most effective and modern approach (e.g., card or PDF-like preview)
- Responsive design is mandatory (portfolio showcase)
- Autosave is nice-to-have, but not required if complex

# Technical Architecture
- Frontend: Angular (with Angular Material for UI components)
- Backend: Spring Boot (Java)
- PDF generation: Use the easiest and most reliable Java library (iText or OpenPDF)
- Backend database: Embedded (H2), no external DB required
- API endpoints:
  - POST /api/resume/pdf (accepts resume JSON, returns PDF)
  - POST /api/resume/save (optional, for draft/autosave)
  - GET /api/resume/:id (optional, for loading saved resumes)
- Deployment: Local environment (no cloud required)
- CORS enabled for local Angular development

# Development Roadmap
## MVP
- Resume input form (all required fields)
- Live preview
- PDF export
- Responsive UI
- File attachment support

## Future Enhancements
- AI-powered resume rewriting to match specific job descriptions
- AI auto-completion for resume sections
- (Optional) Resume sharing, recommendation letter attachment

# Logical Dependency Chain
- Set up project structure (frontend/backend separation)
- Implement resume form and preview (core UI/UX)
- Add PDF export functionality
- Add file attachment support
- (Optional) Implement autosave
- (Future) Integrate AI features for resume rewriting and auto-completion

# Risks and Mitigations
- Main technical risk: AI API key failures or integration issues (for future AI features)
- Mitigation: Ensure robust error handling and clear user feedback for API errors

# Appendix
- All code, instructions, and comments will be in English
- The app will serve as a portfolio-quality project
